                      -----------------------------------
+  The%VPSPRINT+option allows a TSO user to invoke the VTAM Printer Support
   System TSO command processor known as%VPSPRINT.+ VPSPRINT was originally
   written to provide a keyword-for-keyword replacement for the unsupported
   IBM product known as DSPRINT.  Moreover, VPSPRINT not only emulates DSPRINT
   but optionally provides numerous functional enhancements as well as elimi-
   nates all of the operational deficiencies inherent within DSPRINT.

   A non-VSAM data set name and a printer destination are all that is required
   to cause a SYSOUT data set to be generated for hardcopy reproduction.  The
   data is placed on the spool for printing by either%JES2/3 or VPS.+ All other
   displayed fields may be optionally specified; miscellaneous options such as
   "HEXSP" may entered, separated by blanks, in the "miscellaneous" options
   field.  For ease of use the copy count, output class, and FCB have been
   arbitrarily set to 1, A, and 6, respectively.  VPSPRINT forces a default of
   HEADER, NOEJECT, NUM, SINGLE; PAGELEN, BMARGIN, and TMARGIN have no defaults.
   Consult%"VPS Control Command Processor User's Guide",+available from the
   vendor, for detailed operational guidelines.
