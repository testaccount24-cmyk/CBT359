+  The%VPS CONTROL+option allows you to invoke the VTAM Printer Support
   System TSO command processor.  This command processor, known as%VPS
   CONTROL,+is a full-screen command processor used for controlling any
   printer within the VPS network.  This interface allows a user not
   familiar with MVS or VPS commands to control one or more VPS printers.

   Security is built into VPS Control to assure uninterrupted and continuous
   operation of VPS and the network of printers it controls.  Criteria is
   established, based upon a security table, by the technical support personnel
   responsible for the VPS system.  Once the VPS primary option panel has been
   selected and displayed, requests may be initiated by supplying a printer
   name and an appropriate control option.  After VPS has processed the user's
   requested option, the primary menu is re-displayed and VPS Control is now
   ready for the next request.

   The%User's Guide+provides all information necessary for using VPS CONTROL.
